      <p>
        Hi, I'm Divyashakti — a frontend developer with a passion for building resilient, scalable React applications. I thrive on solving complex UI challenges and transforming brittle logic into dynamic, future-proof solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey began with curiosity and a love for clean code. Over time, I’ve honed my skills in debugging, dynamic rendering, and architectural clarity. Whether it’s parsing unpredictable API data or designing intuitive user experiences, I approach each problem with patience, precision, and a growth mindset.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blog is my space to share insights, tutorials, and lessons learned from the trenches of web development. I believe in learning out loud, and I’m excited to connect with fellow developers who value clarity, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
      </p>
